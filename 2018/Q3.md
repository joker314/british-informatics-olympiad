This is a breadth-first search question. This is a technique which has its [own write-up](https://github.com/joker314/british-informatics-olympiad/blob/master/BFS.md).

This is very slightly different because there is no `target_node`. Instead, we need to find out how many layers we generate before there are no more nodes left. The breadth-first search write-up discusses how you would do this (i.e., by having the while loop check if `layer` contains any elements). You would then remove the check for whether the child is equal to the target node, and then you would return the value of `distance` after the `while` loop exits.

Generating the children needs to also be changed substantially so that it matches the problem.

Here is our final code:

```python
length = int(input())
origin_node = input()

def get_children(parent):
  children = []
  out_of_range = -1 # Can't possibly be between the two digits
  for i in range(length - 1):
    left = int(parent[i - 1]) if i - 1 > 0 else out_of_range
    a, b = int(parent[i]), int(parent[i + 1])
    right = int(parent[i + 2]) if i + 2 < length else out_of_range
    
    small = min(a, b)
    big = max(a, b)
    
    if small <= left <= big or small <= right <= big:
      children.append(parent[:i] + b + a + parent[i + 2:]) # todo: types
      
  return children
    

layer = [origin_node]
seen = set(layer)

distance = 0

def bfs():
  global seen, layer, distance
  
  while layer:
    next_layer = []
    for parent in layer:
      for child in get_children(parent):
        if child in seen:
          continue
        
        next_layer.append(child)
        seen.add(child)
    layer = next_layer
    distance += 1
  return distance

print(bfs())
```
