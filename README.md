# British Informatics Olympiad

## What is this repository?
The [British Informatics Olympiad](https://olympiad.org.uk) is "the national computing competition for
schools and colleges".

This repository contains write-ups for many of the problems. It particularly focuses on the Round 1 problems. I typically will not include a write-up if I did not solve the problem completely by myself; instead I will try to link to any resources I found helpful.

I've written all of my Round 1 answers in Python.

## General Advice
Question 1 does not typically require the most efficient algorithm because the test cases will be restricted to very small sizes. However, it is possible that the source code will be reviewed if you get very high marks, and may form part of selection criteria for Round 2.

Question 2 is an implementation challenge.

Question 3 is a problem-solving challenge. In most years, it involves either finding the *n*th term in a sequence, or executing a breadth-first search on a graph (the graph may not be obvious). Becoming good at these two tasks will, in most cases, be very advantageous when solving Question 3's.
